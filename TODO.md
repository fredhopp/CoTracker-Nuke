# CoTracker Nuke App - TODO List

## Status Overview
- **Current Status**: âœ… Production ready with optimized STMap generation and unified processing
- **Recent Major Features**: âœ… Delaunay hull detection + unified mask/STMap processing + performance optimization
- **Architecture**: âœ… Fully modular structure with clean separation of concerns
- **Current Priority**: Feature complete - ready for production use with advanced STMap and optimized processing

## Current Tasks

### ðŸš€ Future Enhancements (Optional)
- [ ] **Export Formats** - Add support for other compositing software (Flame, etc.)
- [ ] **Desktop App Conversion** - Convert Gradio web interface to PySide6 desktop app with native UI
- [ ] **Cross-Platform Packaging** - Set up PyInstaller with spec file for Windows, macOS, and Linux builds
- [ ] **Installer Creation** - Create installers for Windows (Inno Setup), macOS, and Linux distributions
- [ ] **Rocky Linux Build** - Set up GitHub Actions workflow to build for Rocky Linux using Docker container
- [ ] **Docker Build Environment** - Create Dockerfile.rocky with Rocky Linux 9 base image and dependencies
- [ ] **Build Testing** - Test Rocky Linux build process and verify executable works on target system
- [x] **Grid Point Spacing** - Check if the grid of points is taking the ratio of image as a parameter to have checkerboard like spacing
- [ ] **Frame Rate Handling** - Check if the video is working at a set 24fps or properly considering 23.976 fps
- [ ] **STMap Advanced Interpolation** - Implement memory-efficient bicubic interpolation for STMap generation (Delaunay removed due to memory issues)
- [x] **STMap Performance Optimization** - Apply vectorized NaN handling to STMap generation for better performance
- [x] **Enhanced STMap Block Offset Technique** - Implemented proper segment-based algorithm for fringe pixels with Delaunay hull detection
- [x] **Consolidate EXR Output** - Merged enhanced STMap functionality into regular STMap export:
  - Regular STMap sequence outputs RGBA EXR with embedded animated mask in alpha channel
  - Removed separate "Enhanced STMap" section from UI (regular STMap handles everything)
  - Removed "Animated Mask Export" section from UI (mask is embedded in STMap alpha channel)
  - Single unified export provides both STMap coordinates and animated mask in one EXR sequence
- [x] **STMap Frame Range Integration** - Start and end frame need to take the Image Sequence Start Frame into account. The parameter should default to first and last frame
- [x] **STMap Output Path Handling** - The output path for EXR needs to be absolute in the status and clipboard
- [x] **STMap Filename Convention** - The EXR filename needs to conform to our convention: the user needs to be able to pick a path the same way he does for the .nk file. It should default to CoTracker_date_time.%04d.exr ("." not "_" as a separator)
- [x] **STMap Black Output Fix** - The exported EXR files are black (investigate coordinate mapping issue)
- [x] **STMap Reference Frame Fix** - STMap now uses the actual user-selected reference frame instead of hardcoded frame 0
- [x] **STMap UI Layout Optimization** - Condensed UI layout to use less vertical space
- [x] **STMap Output Folder Structure** - Updated to use nested folder structure: outputs/CoTracker_date_time_stmap/


### ðŸ”§ Maintenance Tasks
- [ ] **Testing** - Comprehensive testing across different video formats and resolutions
- [ ] **Documentation** - Add video tutorials and advanced usage examples
- [ ] **Gradio Update** - Monitor Gradio GitHub issue #7529 for ImageEditor drawing interactivity fix and update when resolved
