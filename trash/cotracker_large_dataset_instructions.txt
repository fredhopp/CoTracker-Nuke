CoTracker Large Dataset Nuke Import:

File: temp/cotracker_large_104pts_nuke.py
Data: 104 points, frames 0-113 (11,275 quality keyframes)

DATASET STATISTICS:
- Total rows processed: 11,856
- Points preserved: ALL 104 points
- Keyframes filtered out: 581 (low confidence/invisible)
- Valid keyframes: 11,275
- Full coverage points: 78 (114 keyframes each)
- Partial coverage points: 26 (gaps due to filtering)

PERFORMANCE TEST INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Open Nuke
2. Script Editor (Alt+Shift+S)
3. Load: temp/cotracker_large_104pts_nuke.py
4. Run (Ctrl+Enter)
5. Monitor console for timing information

EXPECTED PERFORMANCE:
- Data loading: ~0.01 seconds
- Track creation: ~10-30 seconds (estimated)
- Total time: ~30-60 seconds (estimated)

OPTIMIZATIONS INCLUDED:
- Direct CSV loading (no embedded data)
- Progress indicators every 20 tracks
- Minimal console output during creation
- Coordinate system conversion
- Quality filtering (confidence >= 0.5)

WHAT TO MONITOR:
- Memory usage during track creation
- Console timing reports
- Nuke responsiveness
- Final track count verification

RESULT:
- Tracker4 node "CoTracker_Large_104pts"
- 104 tracks ready for match-moving/stabilization
- High-quality keyframes only

NOTE:
- Script assumes 1080p video (1920x1080)
- Loads data directly from CSV for better memory efficiency
- Some tracks have gaps where confidence was too low
- This tests real-world performance with substantial data
